timetableJS is an online tool used to solve the problem of scheduling classes into discrete time blocks,
minimizing the number of conflicts for the students taking classes. To use timetableJS, a data file and
settings file are required. 

Data File:
  The data file should be a CSV file with two fields <CLASS_ID>, <STUDENT_ID> per line, specifying the 
  classes that each student takes.

Settings File:
  The settings file is a JSON file used to specify the available time blocks for each class and the 
  parameters used in the scheduling algorithm. Below is an annotated template JSON file:
    {
      //a whitelist of blocks for each class
      "classes" : {
        "CLASS1_ID" : ["BLOCK_1", "BLOCK_2", ..., "BLOCK_N1"],
        "CLASS2_ID" : ["BLOCK_1", "BLOCK_2", ..., "BLOCK_N2"],
        .
        .
        .
        "CLASSM_ID" : ["BLOCK_1", "BLOCK_2", ..., "BLOCK_NM"],
      }
      //the list of all possible time blocks.
      //any classes omitted in the whitelist may be put into any of the possible time blocks
      "blocks" : [],
      //specify the algorithm to use (genetic algorithm in this case)
      "algorithm" : "GA",
      //specify any algorithm specific settings afterwards
      "iterations" : "300",
      "populationSize" : "1000",
    }
